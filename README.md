# BCDiploma: Certificate Manager Plugin For Custom Transaction Certificate-Data

![Test](https://github.com/kristjank/certificate-manager/workflows/Test/badge.svg)


Registered Transaction is fully compatible with existing [API (api/transactions/)](https://api.ark.dev/public-rest-api/endpoints/transactions)

## STEP 1: dApp Installation

```bash
cd plugins/ #location for loading of custom non-core dApps
git submodule add -f https://gitlab.com/ark-x-bcdiploma/certificate-manager/
cd certificate-manager
```

**IMPORTANT**
After you have changed the content of `plugins.js` you need to run `yarn setup` from the `core` root folder. This will pick up your newly registered plugin and build it.

> You can create more transaction payloads by looking at the `__tests__` folder. In short it is as simple as:

```typescript
     const builder = new CertifiedDataBuilder();
        const actual = builder
            .certifiedDataAsset({ data: "certifieddatatostore" })
            .nonce("1")
            .sign("oil cricket silent piece cash isolate echo venture nation grit bullet have");

    console.log(actual.build().toJson());
```

You are using the builder classes you already implemented as part of the plugin.
